# Giftastic-API

## Overview of Assignment: ##

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, we had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of our site.

## Developer Notes: ##

I used an array of items that show funny reaction memes. There is an input box that allows users to add their own reaction meme's to the list. When a button is clicked the GIPHY API will generate 10 gifs in that catagory with the rating of the gif appended.

## Tools ##
